I graduated with a Data Science degree from [Multimedia University](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Multimedia_University). Currently working on Machine Learning infrastructure and operations engineering at [Moneylion](https://www.moneylion.com/). Previously I interned at [Tapway](https://gotapway.com/) as an MLOps Engineer, built [ParcelDaily](https://www.parceldaily.com/) as their sole Backend Software Engineer, and did Machine Learning and Computer Vision research at [ViPr Lab](https://viprlab.github.io/). I like distributed systems, machine learning infrastructure and algorithms.
